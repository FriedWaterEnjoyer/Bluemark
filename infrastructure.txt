(Btw, btw, whenever the user clicks on his/her profile picture - then show them an option to logout).

Sidequest - TODO: implement 2-factor-authentication (2FA) (+ possibly Email verification). I'll do it probably after the main part of the project's already done.
(Mark it with an exclamation mark if it's not set up).

Also, also, implement "forgot password" in login.

Also, also, also, implement night-dark mode in user's profile page.

Man this is fun :D :D :D
