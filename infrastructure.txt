TODO: Implement these features: let the user delete their account.

After doing everything above - Git commit.



Next step - pls implement product pages,

after that - cart and payment functionalities,

then the search function,

after that - let the user see what products and videos they've uploaded, as well as their purchase history,

and the last - video functionality.



And after that - I think my mega project will be done :D


Ooooooh boy, I have a lot of work to do :D

Can't complain though, it's really fun :3
