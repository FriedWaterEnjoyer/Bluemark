(Btw, btw, whenever the user clicks on his/her profile picture - then show them an option to logout).


For mobile - switch overflow-y to auto and let the user scroll - For every category show 2/4 (prolly 4) items.


Sidequest - TODO: implement 2-factor-authentication (2FA) (+ possibly Email verification). I'll do it probably after the main part of the project's already done.
(Mark it with an exclamation mark if it's not set up).

Also, also, implement "forgot password" in login.

Also, also, also, implement night-dark mode in user's profile page.
